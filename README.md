# BigInteger
BigInteger Colaborative Project

## AP Computer Science Principles Achievements
Each of the methods in this project are different achievements.
Students should break up the project into bite sized pieces and work in their own feature branches.
E.g. a branch for comparison-operators.

Each branch should incorporate a UnitTest method to be called in the Program.cs for testing purposes.

Students will earn credit for completing achievements within the project or for creating their own new achievements that fit well with the project.
